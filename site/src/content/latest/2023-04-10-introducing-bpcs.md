Introducing [BPCS - the Better Patterson Council Site](https://council.openpatterson.org/)!
We're excited to provide an alternative to the official Patterson Council Site that's easier to use and more accessible for everyone in the community.

Our goal with BPCS is to provide an online hub for Patterson residents to stay informed and engaged with their local government. Whether you're interested in the city council meeting schedule or local government initiatives, BPCS has got you covered. We want to make sure that everyone in the community has access to important information and resources, and our hope is that BPCS will serve as a valuable tool for Patterson residents.

One of our key priorities is accessibility. We believe that everyone should be able to access important information about their local government, regardless of their background or ability. That's why we're thrilled to announce that we'll be adding Spanish translations to the site in the near future, with the possibility of more languages to come.

We also welcome any feedback or feature requests you may have. If there's something you'd like to see on BPCS, or if you have any suggestions for how we can improve the site, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at [carlos@openpatterson.org](mailto:carlos@openpatterson.org).

In addition to being a resource for the community, BPCS is also an opportunity for us to showcase the power of open source software and collaboration. We believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, and that the best way to build great software is by working together. That's why BPCS is built using open source tools and is available to everyone for free.

We're excited to see how BPCS evolves and grows over time, and we hope that you'll join us on this journey. You can check out the site at [council.openpatterson.org](https://council.openpatterson.org/), and we encourage you to explore the site and let us know what you think.
