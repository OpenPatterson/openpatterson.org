## Overview

We are supporting Center for Human Services in migrating their on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. This will help improve security, reliability, and scalability for CHS.

Along with this, we are setting up reporting infrastructure for CHS to help them better understand their data and make informed decisions.

To make sure that the migration is successful, we are working closely with CHS to understand their needs and requirements. We are also providing training to their team to help them get up to speed with the new infrastructure.
