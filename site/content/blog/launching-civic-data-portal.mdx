We're thrilled to announce the launch of Patterson's first comprehensive open data portal, a project that has been in development for the past six months.

This new platform democratizes access to civic data, allowing residents, researchers, journalists, and developers to explore, download, and build upon the city's public information resources.

The portal includes datasets from various city departments, including budget information, public works projects, crime statistics, and community development initiatives. All data is available in machine-readable formats with clear documentation and APIs for developers.

Our team of volunteer developers worked closely with city officials to identify the most valuable datasets and ensure they're presented in a way that's accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.

We believe that open data is a cornerstone of transparent governance and civic engagement. When citizens have access to the same information as their government, they can participate more meaningfully in the decisions that affect their communities.

In the coming months, we'll be hosting workshops to help community members learn how to use the portal effectively. We're also planning hackathons to encourage the development of applications that leverage this data for public benefit.

This project represents what Open Patterson is all about: using technology to bridge the gap between government and citizens, and empowering communities through access to information.

Civic technology—or "civic tech" for short—refers to the use of technology for the public good, particularly to facilitate engagement between citizens and government. But what does that really mean, and why does it matter?

## What is Civic Tech?

At its core, civic tech encompasses tools, platforms, and digital services designed to:
- Improve access to government services
- Increase transparency in governance
- Facilitate citizen participation in decision-making
- Solve community problems through collaborative approaches

These can range from mobile apps that let you report potholes to sophisticated data visualization platforms that make city budgets understandable to the average person.

## Why Does Civic Tech Matter?

In an era of declining trust in institutions, civic tech offers a path to rebuild the relationship between citizens and their government. By making government more accessible, transparent, and responsive, civic tech can:
- Empower citizens with information and tools to participate meaningfully in civic life
- Help government agencies deliver services more efficiently and effectively
- Create opportunities for collaboration between diverse stakeholders
- Bridge digital divides and ensure equitable access to public resources

## How Does Civic Tech Work in Practice?

Successful civic tech projects typically share a few key characteristics:
- They address real needs identified by the community
- They're designed with, not just for, the people who will use them
- They're accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise
- They're sustainable, with plans for maintenance and updates

At Open Patterson, our approach to civic tech is deeply collaborative. We bring together technologists, government officials, and community members to identify challenges and co-create solutions. We believe that the best civic tech emerges from this kind of cross-sector partnership.

## Getting Involved

You don't need to be a programmer to contribute to civic tech. The field needs people with all kinds of skills—from design and project management to community organizing and user testing.

If you're interested in exploring civic tech, here are some ways to start:
- Attend a civic hack night or community tech meetup
- Explore open data portals for your city or state
- Volunteer with a local civic tech organization (like us!)
- Advocate for open data and digital services in your community

Civic tech is ultimately about people, not just technology. It's about creating tools that strengthen democracy, foster community, and make public institutions work better for everyone.

We're excited to announce a new partnership between Open Patterson and the Patterson Unified School District aimed at introducing students to civic technology and creating pathways to careers in tech.

This initiative, which we're calling "Code for Community," will bring hands-on technology education to middle and high school students across the district, with a focus on using tech skills to address local challenges.

## The program has three main components:

### 1. Classroom Curriculum

We're developing a flexible curriculum that teachers can integrate into existing computer science, social studies, or elective courses. The materials introduce students to concepts like open data, user-centered design, and coding for social impact.

### 2. After-School Clubs

Starting next month, we'll launch after-school civic tech clubs at three pilot schools. These clubs will give students the opportunity to work on real projects in collaboration with city departments and community organizations.

### 3. Summer Internships

For high school students, we're creating a summer internship program that pairs students with tech mentors from local companies and our volunteer network. Interns will work on civic tech projects while developing professional skills and building their portfolios.

"This partnership aligns perfectly with our goal of providing relevant, real-world learning experiences for our students," says Dr. Elena Rodriguez, Superintendent of Patterson Unified. "We want our students to see how the skills they're learning can be applied to improve their community."

The initiative particularly aims to engage students from groups traditionally underrepresented in tech, including girls, students of color, and those from low-income households.

"Technology should be built by the diverse communities it serves," notes Marcus Johnson, Open Patterson's Education Coordinator. "By introducing civic tech to students from all backgrounds, we're not just creating pathways to good careers—we're ensuring that the next generation of technology better reflects and serves everyone in our community."

Teachers, students, and parents interested in learning more about the program can attend our information session on April 5th at the Patterson Community Center, or contact education@openpatterson.org.

title: Making Digital Services Accessible for All
date: 2025-03-05
category: Accessibility
excerpt: Our commitment to ensuring that the digital tools we build are accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities.
image: /placeholder.svg?height=400&width=800
---

At Open Patterson, we believe that civic technology should serve everyone in our community—including the estimated 25% of Americans who have some type of disability. In this post, we want to share our approach to digital accessibility and why we consider it fundamental to our mission.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Digital accessibility isn't just a nice-to-have feature or a compliance checkbox—it's a civil rights issue. When digital services aren't accessible, they create barriers that exclude people with disabilities from fully participating in civic life.

This is particularly important for government services, which everyone has a right to access. Inaccessible websites, forms, or applications can prevent people from accessing vital information, applying for benefits, reporting issues, or participating in public feedback processes.

## Our Accessibility Principles

All Open Patterson projects follow these core principles:

### 1. Accessibility from the start

We build accessibility into our design and development process from day one, rather than treating it as an afterthought. This approach is not only more effective but often more efficient.

### 2. Testing with real users

We include people with various disabilities in our user testing process to ensure our solutions work with assistive technologies and meet real-world needs.

### 3. Following standards

We adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards as a minimum baseline for all our projects.

### 4. Continuous improvement

We regularly audit our existing tools and make improvements based on user feedback and evolving best practices.

## Recent Accessibility Improvements

Over the past six months, we've made significant accessibility enhancements to several projects:

- The City Council Meeting Tracker now includes transcripts for all video content and improved keyboard navigation
- Our Community Resource Finder has been redesigned with enhanced screen reader compatibility and color contrast
- The Permit Application Portal now supports alternative input methods and includes clearer error messages

## Accessibility Benefits Everyone

It's worth noting that accessible design often improves the experience for all users. Features originally designed for people with disabilities—like captions, voice interfaces, and keyboard shortcuts—frequently become popular with the broader public.

Similarly, clear language, intuitive navigation, and mobile-friendly design help everyone, especially those with limited technical skills or English proficiency.

## Get Involved

We're always looking to improve our accessibility practices. If you have expertise in this area or experience using assistive technologies, we'd love your input on our projects. Contact us at accessibility@openpatterson.org to get involved.

And if you encounter accessibility barriers on any of our tools or websites, please let us know so we can address them promptly.

By prioritizing accessibility, we're working to ensure that civic technology truly serves its purpose: making government more accessible and responsive to all citizens, without exception.

title: The Case for Open Source in Government
date: 2025-02-18
category: Open Source
excerpt: Why we believe government software should be open source, and how it benefits both agencies and citizens.
image: /placeholder.svg?height=400&width=800
---

At Open Patterson, one of our core principles is that government software should be open source whenever possible. In this post, we'll explain what that means and why we believe it's so important for the future of civic technology.

## What is Open Source Software?

Open source software is code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. Unlike proprietary software, which keeps its source code secret, open source projects make their code publicly available for others to view, use, and build upon.

This approach has powered some of the world's most important digital infrastructure, from the Linux operating system to the WordPress platform that runs millions of websites.

## Why Government Software Should Be Open Source

There are compelling reasons for government agencies to embrace open source:

### 1. Transparency and Trust

When government code is open, citizens can see exactly how their digital services work. This transparency builds trust and accountability, especially for sensitive systems like those used in voting or benefits determination.

### 2. Cost Efficiency

Open source can significantly reduce costs for government agencies. There are no licensing fees, and the ability to share code between jurisdictions prevents wasteful duplication of effort. Why should every city pay to build the same permit system from scratch?

### 3. Security Through Scrutiny

While it might seem counterintuitive, open source software is often more secure than closed alternatives. When code is open to review, more eyes can spot and fix vulnerabilities before they're exploited.

### 4. Flexibility and Control

With open source, agencies maintain control over their digital infrastructure. They're not locked into a single vendor's ecosystem or subject to unexpected price increases or end-of-support decisions.

### 5. Collaborative Innovation

Open source enables collaboration between government agencies, civic tech organizations, and individual contributors. This pooling of resources and expertise leads to better, more innovative solutions.

## Real-World Success Stories

The benefits of open source in government aren't theoretical—they're being demonstrated around the world:

- The United Kingdom's GOV.UK platform has saved millions of pounds while delivering vastly improved digital services
- The U.S. Digital Service and 18F have championed open source development for federal projects
- Smaller cities like Barcelona have built comprehensive open source digital infrastructure

## Our Approach

All software developed by Open Patterson is released under open source licenses, typically the MIT License. This means that other communities can freely adapt our work to their needs.

We also prioritize contributing to existing open source projects rather than building from scratch whenever possible. This approach allows us to leverage the work of the broader civic tech community and focus our limited resources on local customization and implementation.

## Challenges and Considerations

We recognize that adopting open source isn't always straightforward. Government agencies often face legitimate concerns about support, procurement processes, and integration with existing systems.

Part of our work involves helping local government navigate these challenges—providing documentation, training, and ongoing support for the open source solutions we implement.

## Join the Movement

If you're a government employee, technology professional, or engaged citizen interested in promoting open source in government, we'd love to connect. Reach out to us at opensource@openpatterson.org to learn more about how you can get involved.

By embracing open source principles, we can build more transparent, efficient, and collaborative government technology—technology that truly serves the public interest.
