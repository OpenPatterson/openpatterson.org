As the end of 2023 approaches, we'd like to provide an update on what we have done, what we have learned, and what we have planned for next year.

## Our Wins

We are celebrating 3 main wins:

First, we made and launched our first project, BPCS, the Better Patterson Council Site. You can find that here ([link](https://council.openpatterson.org/)). Our alternative to our town's Council Site, which we find heavy, unattractive, and sometimes hard to navigate. Check out our launch blog post [here](https://www.openpatterson.org/latest/2023-04-10-introducing-bpcs) if you would like to read more.

Second, we found our first project partner in the Center for Human Services, one of the largest nonprofits in Stanislaus County. This is still an in-progress project so we will share more later.

Finally, the fact that we still exist is a win in our book. Like many organizations previously in Code for America's Brigade Network, we were not sure if we'd continue to exist. Luckily, we were able to find a new home here with the Open Collective.

As a bonus, we have been able to achieve all these wins without spending any money, which is good considering we haven't had any money come in yet, but we will talk about that more in the next section.

## Our Learnings

We have learned that we need to focus more on building out our community. We continue to be a tiny team, so tiny that each person is critical and if someone is unavailable our projects can easily fall off the rails. So, for 2024 we plan on working on growing and building out the community to have some level of redundancy and make sure no one has too much work on their plate.

Also, despite not spending any money which is good because we have none, this has been a limiting factor. It has made us creative in stretching out the free tiers of many developer services, but we have realized we must put some work into fundraising so that money is not as much of a limiting factor. Luckily, we have some folks tentatively pledged to donate next year, so we hope to share more soon.

## Looking Forward

Our first goal is to finish our work, or at least the first phase of work, with the Center for Human Services ASAP. We hope they will become a long-term partner as we begin to partner with more local nonprofits.

Second, we hope to recruit some college students to get them more involved in the community and to start building out more talent locally. Despite having several colleges in our area, the technology scene is severely lacking. We hope to partner with these students and other local organizations to start improving it.

Finally, AI has been the hot new thing this year, but it does not seem to have made much impact yet in the Civic Tech scene. We have some ideas we hope to work on in 2024. More soon.

Thanks,  
Carlos Ortega  
Open Patterson Lead

Introducing [BPCS - the Better Patterson Council Site](https://council.openpatterson.org/)!

We're excited to provide an alternative to the official Patterson Council Site that's easier to use and more accessible for everyone in the community.

Our goal with BPCS is to provide an online hub for Patterson residents to stay informed and engaged with their local government. Whether you're interested in the city council meeting schedule or local government initiatives, BPCS has got you covered. We want to make sure that everyone in the community has access to important information and resources, and our hope is that BPCS will serve as a valuable tool for Patterson residents.

One of our key priorities is accessibility. We believe that everyone should be able to access important information about their local government, regardless of their background or ability. That's why we're thrilled to announce that we'll be adding Spanish translations to the site in the near future, with the possibility of more languages to come.

We also welcome any feedback or feature requests you may have. If there's something you'd like to see on BPCS, or if you have any suggestions for how we can improve the site, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at [carlos@openpatterson.org](mailto:carlos@openpatterson.org).

In addition to being a resource for the community, BPCS is also an opportunity for us to showcase the power of open source software and collaboration. We believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, and that the best way to build great software is by working together. That's why BPCS is built using open source tools and is available to everyone for free.

We're excited to see how BPCS evolves and grows over time, and we hope that you'll join us on this journey. You can check out the site at [council.openpatterson.org](https://council.openpatterson.org/), and we encourage you to explore the site and let us know what you think.

## Before We Introduce Ourselves

Before we can introduce ourselves, we must explain why we felt it was necessary to launch a Code for America Brigade in Patterson.

Despite being so close to the Bay Area and Silicon Valley, we have found no tech community pop up in Patterson, or Stanislaus County in general.

As a result, we have found that the vast majority of Computer Science graduates in the area are forced to move away for more opportunities.

In turn, where other, larger, cities find themselves with thriving tech communities and folks willing to contribute their tech skills to the community, Patterson has seen none of that.

## Where We Step In

Rather than reinventing the wheel, we decided to adopt a framework and join an established network, the [Code for America Brigade Network](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/).

Code for America Brigades are volunteer-led groups made up of engineers, policy advocates, designers, community organizers, and folks with skills to contribute.

Despite having no tech community and very few companies using technology in the area, we do have folks with these skills. The largest community being undergraduate students with a hunger to learn and skills to contribute.

## Next Steps

We are already working on our first projects, the priority being a Better Patterson Council Website. However, we need volunteers. The more volunteers, the greater impact Open Patterson can have in Patterson, and maybe eventually in all of Stanislaus County. If you are interested in joining visit the "Join Us" tab at the top of this page. Contact [carlos@openpatterson.org](mailto:carlos@openpatterson.org) if you have any questions.

Do you represent a Nonprofit or a Local Government Agency?

We'd love to work with you. Email [carlos@openpatterson.org](mailto:carlos@openpatterson.org)
