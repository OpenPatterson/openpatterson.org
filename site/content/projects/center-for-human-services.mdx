## Overview

We are supporting Center for Human Services in migrating their on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. This will help improve security, reliability, and scalability for CHS.

Along with this, we are setting up reporting infrastructure for CHS to help them better understand their data and make informed decisions.

To make sure that the migration is successful, we are working closely with CHS to understand their needs and requirements. We are also providing training to their team to help them get up to speed with the new infrastructure.

## What we did

- Infrastructure planning and implementation
- AWS cloud migration
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Data reporting infrastructure
- Staff training and knowledge transfer

## Overview

We're excited to provide an alternative to the official Patterson Council Site that's easier to use and more accessible for everyone in the community.

Our goal with BPCS is to provide an online hub for Patterson residents to stay informed and engaged with their local government. Whether you're interested in the city council meeting schedule or local government initiatives, BPCS has got you covered. We want to make sure that everyone in the community has access to important information and resources, and our hope is that BPCS will serve as a valuable tool for Patterson residents.

## What we did

- Built a modern frontend using Next.js
- Developed a custom web scraper to collect council data
- Created a user-friendly interface for browsing council meetings and documents
- Set up cloud infrastructure for reliable hosting
- Implemented accessibility features for all users

## Testimonial

"We created BPCS as a tool we wanted. We were frustrated with the process of finding and navigating the original site, so we decided to build our own."
â€” Carlos Ortega, Founder of Open Patterson
