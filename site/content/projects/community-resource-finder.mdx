# Community Resource Finder

The Community Resource Finder is a web application designed to help residents of Patterson locate and access essential services and resources in their community.

## The Problem

Many residents, especially newcomers, low-income individuals, and non-English speakers, struggle to find information about available community resources. These resources are often scattered across different websites, organizations, and government departments, making them difficult to discover and navigate.

## Our Solution

We created an interactive map-based application that:

- Displays all community resources in a single, easy-to-use interface
- Allows users to filter resources by category (food, housing, healthcare, education, etc.)
- Provides detailed information about each resource, including services offered, eligibility requirements, hours of operation, and contact information
- Offers multilingual support to serve Patterson's diverse population
- Works well on mobile devices for users without computer access

## Technical Implementation

The Resource Finder is built with a modern tech stack:

- **Frontend**: React with Mapbox GL for interactive mapping
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible data storage
- **Authentication**: JWT for secure admin access
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Docker and deployed on Vercel

## Impact

Since launching in early 2025, the Community Resource Finder has:

- Helped over 2,000 residents connect with local services
- Reduced the time spent searching for resources by an average of 75%
- Increased awareness and utilization of underused community programs
- Provided valuable data to city officials about resource gaps and service needs

## Future Development

We're currently working on several enhancements:

1. Adding a "suggest a resource" feature for community contributions
2. Implementing a notification system for service updates
3. Creating a companion mobile app for offline access
4. Expanding to neighboring communities

## Get Involved

We welcome contributions from developers, designers, and community members. Check out our GitHub repository to learn how you can help improve this project.

## Impact

In the first six months since launch, the Council Tracker has:

- Attracted over 1,500 regular users (approximately 5% of Patterson's population)
- Increased public comments at council meetings by 35%
- Been recognized by the California League of Cities as an innovative civic technology solution
- Helped identify and resolve accessibility issues in the city's official meeting documentation

## Future Development

We're working on several enhancements to the platform:

1. Adding historical meeting data going back 10 years
2. Creating visualization tools for budget discussions and voting patterns
3. Implementing a community discussion feature for each agenda item
4. Developing integrations with other civic engagement platforms

# Open Budget Explorer

The Open Budget Explorer is an interactive visualization tool that makes Patterson's municipal finances transparent and understandable to all citizens.

## The Problem

City budgets are complex documents that are difficult for the average resident to understand:

- Budget documents are often hundreds of pages long and filled with technical jargon
- Financial data is presented in ways that require specialized knowledge to interpret
- It's difficult to track changes in spending priorities over time

- The budget process itself is opaque to most citizens

## Our Solution

We created an interactive platform that:

- Visualizes budget data through intuitive charts and graphs
- Allows users to explore spending by department, project, or category
- Provides plain-language explanations of budget terminology and processes
- Enables year-to-year comparisons to identify trends
- Contextualizes spending with relevant metrics and outcomes
- Highlights opportunities for public input in the budget process

## Technical Implementation

The Budget Explorer leverages several technologies:

- **Data Processing**: Python scripts for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured financial data storage
- **API**: RESTful API for accessing budget data
- **Automation**: Scripts to update data when new budget documents are released

## Impact

Since its launch in 2024, the Budget Explorer has:

- Been used by over 3,000 Patterson residents
- Increased attendance at budget town halls by 45%
- Generated 200+ specific questions and comments on the city budget
- Been adopted as an official tool by the city's finance department
- Received recognition from government transparency organizations

## Future Development

We're working on several enhancements:

1. Adding participatory budgeting features to collect resident priorities
2. Creating "budget simulator" functionality to help residents understand tradeoffs
3. Implementing more detailed revenue visualizations
4. Developing comparisons with similar cities
5. Adding narrative elements that explain the stories behind the numbers

# Smart City Sensors Network

The Smart City Sensors Network is an open-source environmental monitoring system that provides real-time data on air quality, noise levels, and other environmental factors across Patterson.

## The Problem

Environmental conditions have a significant impact on public health and quality of life, but:

- Official monitoring stations are sparse and don't capture neighborhood-level variations
- Data is often not accessible to the public in real-time
- Many environmental concerns go undetected or unreported
- Communities lack evidence to advocate for environmental improvements
- The cost of commercial environmental monitoring solutions is prohibitive

## Our Solution

We developed a network of low-cost, community-hosted sensors that:

- Measure key environmental indicators (air quality, noise, temperature, humidity)
- Transmit data in real-time to a central platform
- Display information through user-friendly dashboards and maps
- Alert residents when readings exceed healthy thresholds
- Provide open data for research, advocacy, and policy development
- Can be expanded by community members with technical guidance

## Technical Implementation

The sensor network utilizes several technologies:

- **Hardware**: Arduino-based sensor nodes with multiple environmental sensors
- **Connectivity**: WiFi and LoRaWAN for data transmission
- **Protocol**: MQTT for efficient IoT communication
- **Backend**: Python-based data processing and storage
- **Visualization**: Grafana dashboards and custom mapping interfaces
- **Alerts**: Automated notification system for threshold violations
- **API**: Open API for third-party applications and research

## Impact

Since deployment began in 2024, the sensor network has:

- Deployed 35 sensors across different Patterson neighborhoods
- Identified several air quality hotspots near industrial areas
- Provided evidence that led to traffic calming measures in high-pollution areas
- Engaged 200+ residents in citizen science and environmental monitoring
- Supported three successful environmental grant applications with data

## Future Development

We're expanding the project in several ways:

1. Adding water quality monitoring capabilities
2. Developing solar-powered sensors for deployment in parks and natural areas
3. Creating educational materials for schools to use the data
4. Building integrations with health tracking applications
5. Expanding to cover 100% of Patterson neighborhoods

## Get Involved

There are many ways to contribute to the Smart City Sensors Network:

- Host a sensor at your home or business
- Help build and maintain sensors (no prior experience required)
- Contribute to the software development
- Analyze data and create visualizations
- Use the data for advocacy and community improvement projects
